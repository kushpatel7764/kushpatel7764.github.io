                This is a simple Ping Pong Game in C-sharp language using Unity Game Engine. The ping pong game, also known as "Pong," has two paddles controlled by players or AI on either side of the screen and a ball that bounces between them. The objective is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle, scoring a point each time they miss it. 
                The game typically starts with the ball in the center, and players use their paddles to move it back and forth. To ensure the game does not go on forever the ball's speed increases as time goes on.

                    I created a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Kotlin using Android Studio. Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their chosen symbol, "X" or "O," with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
                    Players alternate turns until one player achieves the winning condition or the grid is completely filled, resulting in a draw. This game can also be played in a single player mode against an AI as well.

                    The Data Filter Program was created using Python in Visual Studio Code. 
                    The program is designed to filter and display meteorite data from a user-specified text input based on specific criteria. 
                    The program reads the data, filters it according to the user's criteria, and then displays the filtered data in a table format or a new text file or an excel file.

                    This Lottery Store Accounting Application was developed using Swift in Xcode. It's designed to assist small businesses in efficiently calculating the total amount of lottery tickets sold in a day.
                    At the end of the business day, users can open the app and use their iOS device to scan the 2d data matrix on each lottery ticket in their store. The application then calculates and generates a report detailing the number of tickets sold during the day and the expected cash amount that should be in the lottery register. 
                    This simplifies the closing process for the store.

                    The Quiz Sort and Selection Sort Visualization Program is a tool that visually demonstrates how the two different sorting algorithms, Quiz Sort and Selection Sort, operate on a list of items.
                    The program starts by displaying an unsorted list of items on the screen, represented graphically. The user then selects which sorting algorithm they want to visualize.
                    Visual cues like animation can help users understand the sorting process better. At the end of the visualization, the program displays the sorted list and gives statistics like the amount of comparisons made. 
                    This allows users to compare the efficiency and performance of Quiz Sort and Selection Sort in sorting the same set of items.

                One idea for my final project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game Website. The game can be played in single or double player mode. I also wanted to try
                and make the game playable online from two different computers, which will most like require server side scripting for the game. Additionally, 
                the make the website keep track of the which player has the most wins currently so the players konw who is winning.

                Another idea is a online store website. In this website there can be physical iteams, online subscription, or online packages that a person may 
                choose to buy. I want to make such a website so I can better understand how webstores work. Setting up secure payments and understanding the process behind 
                completing the orders recevided will be very useful knowledge to have.
